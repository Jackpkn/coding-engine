# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing Verilog Core API project to improve its functionality, performance, and usability. The project currently provides a lean, editor-agnostic Verilog/SystemVerilog code analysis engine with HTTP API capabilities. The enhancements will focus on completing the AI integration layer, improving the web interface, optimizing performance, and adding advanced features mentioned in the project roadmap.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Verilog Core API, I want enhanced AI-powered code analysis capabilities, so that I can get intelligent insights about my Verilog code including summaries, explanations, and suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests code analysis through the API THEN the system SHALL provide AI-generated code summaries and explanations
2. WHEN a user queries about specific Verilog constructs THEN the system SHALL return contextually relevant AI responses
3. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to basic analysis without AI features
4. IF a user provides an API key THEN the system SHALL use enhanced LLM capabilities for better responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with large Verilog codebases, I want improved performance and scalability, so that I can efficiently analyze projects with thousands of files without significant delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN indexing repositories with over 1000 files THEN the system SHALL complete indexing within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN performing searches on large codebases THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking
4. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to optimize performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the web demo interface, I want an improved and more feature-rich web interface, so that I can better explore and interact with my Verilog code analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing search results THEN the system SHALL display syntax-highlighted code snippets
2. WHEN exploring modules THEN the system SHALL show module hierarchies and relationships
3. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL provide interactive visualizations of module connections
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive WebSocket support for real-time updates, so that I can receive live notifications about code changes and analysis progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL broadcast real-time updates via WebSocket
2. WHEN long-running operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL stream progress updates
3. WHEN clients connect via WebSocket THEN the system SHALL establish reliable bidirectional communication
4. IF WebSocket connections are lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with complex Verilog designs, I want advanced graph visualization capabilities, so that I can understand module instantiation relationships and signal flow in my designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a design THEN the system SHALL generate module instantiation graphs
2. WHEN exploring signal connections THEN the system SHALL show signal flow diagrams
3. WHEN viewing hierarchical designs THEN the system SHALL display interactive hierarchy trees
4. IF graph data is complex THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and zoom capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a VS Code extension user, I want improved extension functionality with better integration, so that I can seamlessly work with Verilog code within my preferred editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using VS Code commands THEN the system SHALL remove deprecated activation events warnings
2. WHEN working with Verilog files THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced IntelliSense capabilities
3. WHEN navigating code THEN the system SHALL offer improved go-to-definition and find-references features
4. IF the API server is unavailable THEN the extension SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying the Verilog Core API, I want robust configuration and monitoring capabilities, so that I can effectively manage and monitor the service in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the service THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration management
2. WHEN monitoring the service THEN the system SHALL provide health metrics and status endpoints
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for performance analysis
